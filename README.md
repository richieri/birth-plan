## üß† How It Works (Technical Summary)

The system is built using Docker and integrates multiple components to offer a seamless and informative user experience. Here's how the process flows (as seen in the diagram):

### 1. **Initial Access**
- The user visits a **WordPress** page, which embeds a **TypeBot** conversation interface.
- **MariaDB** and **Postgres** are used to store user data and conversation states.

### 2. **Privacy & User Verification**
- Disclaimers and privacy policy are presented to the user.
- A **verification code is sent via email** using **Amazon SES**.
- Once verified, the birth plan journey begins.

### 3. **Interactive Birth Plan Creation**
- The flow starts with a default input: _"I want to build a birth plan"_.
- **LLM Agent 1** determines the next topic and question to ask the user.
- **LLM Agent 2** checks for **educational videos** relevant to the topic.
- The system then:
  - Sends the question and any available video to the user.
  - Collects the user's answer.
  - Repeats the cycle until the agent includes the tag `#birth_plan_completed`.

### 4. **Sending the Birth Plan**
- Once complete, the user is notified that the birth plan will be emailed.
- The final plan is sent via **Amazon SES**.
